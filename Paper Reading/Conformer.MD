# [Conformer Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08100.pdf) Notes

CNNs are better are extracting local features while transformers are better for modeling global interactions. Conformer combines CNNs with Transformers. Conformer significantly outperforms other architectures at Automatic Speech Recognition.

CNNs are good for local connectivity but struggle to tie it up with the global context. Thus, a lof of effort has been expended to eradicate this *weakness* of CNNs by techniques such as Residual Layers.
